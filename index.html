										<h2 class="major">My Work Experience</h2>
										<p>I worked at Rovisys Building Technologies, a control system company that has projects world wide. I was a co-op helping on a data center during the summer. I learned a lot about control systems and internal networks during this time. I also learned to configure network switches to communicate with each other and the rest of the system. </p>

										<h2 class="major">My Current Project</h2>
										<p>Im currently working on creating a video game in Unity with a friend. We are designing a 2D platformer rogue-like that takes inspiration from games like Spelunky and Risk of Rain 2, and the Mistborne novels. In this game you will be able to push and pull yourself from specific objects like a magnet, propelling yourself around the level. You'll also be able to pick up randomized power-ups while fighting enemies and navigating interesting platforming sections. Because its a rogue-like, the levels, items you find, and enemies will be randomized to create a unique experience every time.  </p>

											<h3 class="major">Console Shell Made in C</h3>
											<p>I created a simple shell that could run multiple commands at once from one line, and could access and create files. It took advantage of pipelining and threads to work effectively. </p>

											<h3 class="major">Over Terrain Vehicle. Received Best in Mission for that Semester</h3>
											<p>I coded and helped design an over terrain vehicle that could autonomously collect a water sample and test its properties. It could then drive to a specified drop off location. It used an Arduino control the motors and servos.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Algorithms in Assembly</h3>
											<p>I created multiple algorithms in assembly such as the fibonacci number calculator, a palindrome finder, a square root calculator, and a reverse prefix sum calculator.</p>

											<h3 class="major">2D Platformer Video Game</h3>
											<p>I created a video game in Unity that where you play as a ninja and have to traverse obstacles and enemies. The character and enemies both had animations for different actions like walking and jumping.</p>
