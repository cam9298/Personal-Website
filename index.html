										<p> Im currently collaborating with a team to develop a 2D platform roguelike in Unity. It's currently in the very early stages of development, but some of the core features are already in place </p>
										<p> There's a magnetic inspired movement system where the player can attract and repel themselves from metal terrain. This is inspired by one of my favorite book series, Mistborne by Brandon Sanderson, where the characters can push and pull themselves around using metal. </p>
										<p> Another core feature is the one focus at a time. The player can interact with the magnets or use their attacks but not at the same time. This will require the player to be very precise and strategic with their actions.</p>
										<p> We have big plans for this game with 15 equipable weapons, each featuring multiple attacks and unique upgrade paths to provide varied options for the player. We also have 20 planned player upgrades that are random every run, creating a unique experience every time you play. </p>

											<p> I collaborated with a team to create an over-terrain vehicle that autonomously collects and measures different aspects of water within specific size, weight, and cost constraints. I coded and wired the vehicle that took advantage of an over-head camera and an ultra sonic sensor to precisely navigate through the randomized course </p>
